# education_dl_advanced_conv_model
Project made by me while learning DL. Writing own neural network for classification on the CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch. Regularization, normalization of output layers and input data, augmentation are used. It contains two neural networks: a simple one with a small number of layers, having accuracy 0.7255 on test data, and a more complex one with 0.9043.
