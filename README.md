# education_dl_advanced_conv_model
Project made by me while learning DL. Writing own neural network for classification on the CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch. Regularization, normalization of output layers and input data, augmentation, skip-connection are used. It contains three neural networks: a simple one with a small number of layers, having an accuracy of 0.7255 according to test data, a more complex one with 0.9043, and a neural network using skip-connection, having an accuracy of 0.9062
